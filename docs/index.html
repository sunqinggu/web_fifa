                Spain coach Julen Lopetegui says he could use a range of players at No. 9 for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Alvaro Morata, who has scored seven goals and set up three more in 10 Premier League appearances since joining Chelsea from Real Madrid in the summer, and Diego Costa finished as the top scorers in qualifying with five goals apiece.
